# Visual Regression Test Documentation

This document shows the visual state of the editor at different steps in user flows.
Screenshots are automatically generated by running `cargo test`.

**Note**: These screenshots are generated from E2E tests and serve as both:
- Visual regression tests (detect unintended UI changes)
- Living documentation (always up-to-date with the current UI)

## Individual Test Documentation

Each test has its own detailed documentation file with all steps and screenshots.
